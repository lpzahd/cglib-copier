# Deep Copy Tool

## Introduction
The Deep Copy Tool is a Java utility based on Cglib, designed to achieve deep cloning of Java Beans effortlessly. Traditional object copying in Java often leads to unintended side effects, especially with nested or complex object structures. This tool resolves this issue by recursively copying objects and all their nested objects, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

## Features
- Deeply clones Java Beans
- Simple and easy-to-use API
- Leverages Cglib for efficient bytecode manipulation
- Maintains high performance even with large object graphs
